# Reva Fair Android Application

Android side of the Reva fair application, with the android app students can navigate the fair completing quizzes and challenges that fit the stands they need to visit. This app makes it so students who are 'forced' to go fairs can still have fun by completing questions.



## Screenshots

These screenshots give an example of the flow of the application: starting with taking a group photo, selecting categories that they are interested in, and finally navigating the fair and answering questions.
